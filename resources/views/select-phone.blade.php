                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> all screen replacements include both the LCD and digitizer (except iPads). This is
                        the best and most efficient way to perform a screen replacement. Smaller independent retailers
                        may offer screen repairs at a lower price, but many are not replacing the full assembly - only
                        the front glass. </p>
